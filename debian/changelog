ubuntu-packaging-guide (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Don't mix debuild and bzr builddeb in the same guide
    (packaging-new-software).

  [ Jonathan Jesse ]
  * "bzr commit" should be "debcommit" in fixing-a-bug. (LP: #978493)
  * Use 'bzr lp-propose' instead of 'bzr lp-open' (LP: #950227)

  [ Andrew Starr-Bochicchio ]
  * Provide overview of traditional packaging tools (LP: #809925)
  * traditional-packaging.html is empty, but linked to (LP: #885315)
  * Only exclude the -html/_sources dir from compression. Lintian doesn't like
    the changelog not being compressed.
  * For epub packages only install the epub file. Every thing else is just
    leftover from the build process.
  * Install the html/_sources dir. They are linked to on the web site.
  * Adjust paths for new install locations
  * debian/rules: Add a get-orig-source target.
  * Drop udd-newpackage page. It's contents are sufficiently covered in
    the packaging-new-software page (LP: #942754).
  * Fix installation of singlehtml (LP: #1014639).

  [ Andrew Starr-Bochicchio + Daniel Holbach ]
  * provide a means to ship per-language per-flavour packages, if a certain
    level of completeness of the translations is reached. (LP: #961936)

  [ Daniel Holbach ]
  * Integrate sponsoring documentation (setting expectations, explain 
    process). (LP: #996096)
  * Refer to the backports process (LP: #1017984).

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Add python-packaging.rst (LP: #702008)
  * Add guide.css and pygments.css files
