Ubuntu development process
==========================

Each release cycle follows the same general pattern, with the following
major phases. Ubuntu contributors are expected to follow this process closely
to ensure that their work is aligned with that of others. Because of the
time-based release cycle, Ubuntu contributors must be well-coordinated to
produce an on-time release.

See also the article, :doc:`/explanation/releases`, for more details about the
release cadence.

Beginning a new Release
-----------------------

The Ubuntu infrastructure is prepared for a new development branch at the
beginning of each cycle. The package build system is set up, the toolchain
is organized, :term:`seeds` are branched, and many other pieces are made ready
before development can properly begin. Once these preparations are made, the
new branch is officially announced on the
`ubuntu-devel-announce mailing list <https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce>`_ 
and opened for uploads to the :doc:`/explanation/archive`.

.. note::
    See the `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) archive opening announcement email <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2023-October/001341.html>`_
    as an example announcement for an archive opening.

Planning
--------

Ubuntu contributors discuss the targeted features for each release cycle via
the various channels (e.g., IRC, Matrix, Discourse, Launchpad). Some of these
come from strategic priorities for the distribution as a whole, and some are
proposed by individual developers.

The broader open-source community gets together at the :term:`Ubuntu Summit` 
(similar but different to the past 
:term:`Ubuntu Developer Summits <Ubuntu Developer Summit>`) to share
experiences and ideas and to inspire future exciting projects covering
development as well as design, writing, and community leadership with a wide
range of technical skill levels.

The :term:`Canonical` teams meet after every release at the Roadmap Planning 
Sprint to plan the roadmap for the next release and discuss how to implement
the roadmap at the Engineering Sprint.

Merging with Upstream & Feature Development
-------------------------------------------

The first phase of the release cycle is characterized by bringing new releases
of :term:`upstream` components into Ubuntu, either directly or via 
:doc:`Merges and Syncs from Debian </explanation/debian-merges-and-syncs>`. 
Development of planned projects for the release often begins while merging is
still underway, and their development is accelerated once the package archive
is reasonably consistent and usable.

The automatic import of new package versions from Debian ends at the 
:ref:`DebianImportFreeze`.

Stabilization & Deadlines (Freezes)
-----------------------------------

During development, greater caution is gradually exercised in making changes
to Ubuntu to ensure a stable state is reached in time for the final release
date. The typical order and length of the various freezes can be seen on the
current Release Schedule, which is usually posted as a Discourse article under
the `"Release" topic <https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/release/>`_. 

.. note::
    In the past, the Release Schedule was published in the Ubuntu Wiki.
    See for example the `release schedule of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (FocalFossa) <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseSchedule>`_.

During freezes, exceptions must be requested to approve changes.
See :doc:`how to request a freeze exception </how-to/request-freeze-exception>`.

.. _TestingWeeks:

Testing Weeks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During a release's development phase, testing weeks are organized to focus the
Ubuntu community's efforts on testing Ubuntu's latest daily
:term:`ISO images <Image>` and its :term:`flavours <Ubuntu flavours>`. These
weeks are crucial for discovering bugs and getting early feedback about new
features.

.. note::
    The testing weeks replaced the older practice of alpha and beta milestones.
    For example, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) had Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1,
    and Beta 2 Milestones.

    See `the email <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2018-April/004434.html>`_
    that announced the process change.

.. _DebianImportFreeze:

Debian Import Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The automatic import of new packages and versions of existing packages from
Debian gets disabled. The import of a new package or version of an existing
package from Debian has to be requested. 

.. note::

    The general development activity is still unrestricted until the
    Feature Freeze; however, the Feature Freeze is often scheduled for the same
    day.

.. _FeatureFreeze:

Feature Freeze (FF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, Ubuntu developers should stop introducing new features,
packages, and :term:`API`/:term:`ABI` changes and concentrate on fixing bugs
in the current release in development.

.. _User Interface Freeze:

User Interface Freeze (UIF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user interface should be finalized to allow documentation writers and
translators to work on a consistent target that doesn't render screenshots or
documentation obsolete.

After the user interface freeze, the following things are not allowed to change
without a freeze exception:

* the user interface of individual applications that are installed by default,
* the appearance of the desktop,
* the distribution-specific artwork,
* all user-visible strings in the desktop and applications that are installed 
  by default.

.. _DocumentationStringFreeze:

Documentation String Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation strings should no longer be created or modified. This freeze
ensures that the documentation can be accurately translated.

Exceptions to this rule may be considered before release for significant and
glaring typographical errors or exceptional circumstances.

.. _KernelFeatureFreeze:

Kernel Feature Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`kernel` feature development should end at this point, and the
kernels can be considered feature-complete for the release. From now on, only
bugfix changes are expected.

.. note::
    The Kernel Feature Freeze occurs after the :ref:`FeatureFreeze` because
    the Linux Kernel is typically released upstream after the Feature Freeze.
    Additionally, the Kernel Feature Freeze is deliberately scheduled so that
    the Beta images have a fully featured kernel suitable for testing. 

.. _HardwareEnablementFreeze:

Hardware Enablement Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All new hardware enablement tasks for devices targeting the given release
should be finished, and all the respective packages should be in the Ubuntu
package archive. The release team will no longer accept changes in the Ubuntu
package archive related to supporting new image types or platforms.
This freeze ensures that any new platforms are already available for testing
of the beta images and in the weeks leading to the :ref:`FinalFreeze`.

.. note::
    The Hardware Enablement Freeze is usually scheduled for the same day as
    the Beta Freeze.

.. _BetaFreeze:

Beta Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~

For the beta release's preparation, all uploads are queued and subject to
manual approval by the release team. Changes to packages that affect beta
release images (flavours included) require release team approval before
uploading. Uploads for packages that do not affect images will generally be
accepted as time permits.

.. tip::
    You can use the :manpage:`seeded-in-ubuntu(1)` tool, provided by the
    ``ubuntu-dev-tools`` package, to list all the current daily images
    containing a specified package or to determine whether the specified
    package is part of the supported seed. 
    
    If the outputted list is empty, uploading it during a freeze should be
    safe.

The freeze allows Archive Admins to fix package inconsistencies or critical
bugs quickly and in an isolated manner. Once the beta release is shipped, the 
Beta Freeze restrictions no longer apply.

.. _KernelFreeze:

Kernel Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kernel Freeze is a deadline for kernel updates since they require several
lockstep actions that must be folded into the image-building process.

Exceptional circumstances may justify exemptions to the freeze at the
discretion of the release managers.

.. _NonLanguagePackTranslationDeadline:

Non Language Pack Translation Deadline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some translation data cannot currently be updated via the language pack
mechanism. Because these items require more disruptive integration work,
they are subject to an earlier deadline to give time to developers to manually
export translations from Launchpad and integrate them into the package.

This deadline marks the date after which translations for such packages are not
guaranteed to be included in the final release. Depending on the package and
its maintainer's workflow, they may be exported later.

Other packages can still be translated until the
:ref:`LanguagePackTranslationDeadline`.

.. _FinalFreeze:

Final Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This freeze marks an **extremely** high-caution period until the
:ref:`FinalRelease`. Only bug fixes for release-critical, security-critical or
otherwise exceptional circumstantial bugs are included in the Final Release,
which the release team and relevant section teams must confirm.

Unseeded packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Packages in :ref:`ArchiveComponents_Universe` that aren't seeded in any of the
Ubuntu flavours just remain in :ref:`FeatureFreeze` because they do not affect
the release; however, when the Ubuntu package archive is frozen, fixes must be
manually reviewed and accepted by the release team members.

When the Final Release is close (~1.5 days out), developers should consider
uploading to the :ref:`proposed pocket <ArchivePockets_Proposed>`, from which
the release team will cherry-pick into the
:ref:`release pocket <ArchivePockets_Release>` if circumstances allow.
All packages uploaded to the proposed pocket that do not make it into the
release pocket until the Final Release will become candidates for
:ref:`StableReleaseUpdates_Summary`. Therefore, uploads to the proposed pocket
during Final Freeze should meet the requirements of Stable Release Updates if
the upload is not accepted into the release pocket. In particular, the upload
must reference at least one bug, which will be used to track the stable update. 

If you are sure that your upload will be accepted during Final Freeze, you can
upload directly to the release pocket, but be aware that you have to re-upload
after Final Release if the upload gets rejected.

.. _ReleaseCandidate:

Release Candidate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The images produced during the week before the :ref:`FinalRelease` are
considered "release candidates". In an ideal world, the first release candidate
would end up being the Final Release; however, we don't live in a perfect
world, and this week is used to get rid of the last release-critical bugs and
do as much testing as possible. Until the Final Release, changes are only
permitted at the release team's discretion and will only be allowed for
high-priority bugs that might justify delaying the release.

.. _LanguagePackTranslationDeadline:

Language Pack Translation Deadline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translations done up until this date will be included in the final release's
language packs. 

Finalization
------------

As the final release approaches, the focus narrows to fixing "showstopper"
bugs and thoroughly validating the installation images. Every image is tested
to ensure that the installation methods work as advertised. Low-impact bugs
and other issues are deprioritized to focus developers on this effort.

This phase is vital, as severe bugs that affect the experience of booting
or installing the images must be fixed before the final release.
In contrast, ordinary bugs affecting the installed system can be fixed with
Stable Release Updates.

.. _FinalRelease:

Final Release
-------------

Once the :ref:`ReleaseCandidate` ISO is declared stable, it will be announced on the 
`ubuntu-announce mailing list <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/>`_
and referred to as the "Final Release".

.. note::
    See for example the `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) release announcement <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2024-April/000301.html>`_.

.. _StableReleaseUpdates_Summary:

Stable Release Updates
----------------------

Released versions of Ubuntu are intended to be **stable**. This means that
users should be able to rely on their behaviour remaining the same and
therefore, updates are only released under particular circumstances.

The dedicated :doc:`/explanation/stable-release-updates` article describes
these criteria and the procedure for preparing such an update.
