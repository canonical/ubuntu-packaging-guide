Ubuntu development process
==========================

Each release cycle follows the same general pattern, with the following
major phases. Ubuntu contributors are expected to follow this process closely
to ensure that their work is aligned with that of others. Because of the
time-based release cycle, Ubuntu contributors must coordinate well to
produce an on-time release.

See also the article :doc:`/explanation/releases` for more details about the
release cadence.

Beginning a new release
-----------------------

The Ubuntu infrastructure is prepared for a new development branch at the
beginning of each cycle. The package build system is set up, the toolchain
is organised, :term:`seeds <Seeds>` are branched, and many other pieces are made
ready before development can properly begin. Once these preparations are made,
the new branch is officially announced on the
`ubuntu-devel-announce mailing list <https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce>`_ 
and opened for uploads to the :doc:`/explanation/archive`.

.. note::
    See the `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) archive opening announcement email <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-announce/2023-October/001341.html>`_
    as an example.

Planning
--------

Ubuntu contributors discuss the targeted features for each release cycle via
the various channels (e.g., IRC, Matrix, Discourse, Launchpad). Some of these
come from strategic priorities for the distribution as a whole, and some are
proposed by individual developers.

The broader open-source community gets together at the :term:`Ubuntu Summit` 
(similar but different to the past 
:term:`Ubuntu Developer Summits <Ubuntu Developer Summit>`) to share
experiences and ideas and to inspire future projects covering
development as well as design, writing, and community leadership with a wide
range of technical skill levels.


Merging with upstream and feature development
---------------------------------------------

The first phase of the release cycle is characterised by bringing new releases
of :term:`upstream` components into Ubuntu, either directly or via 
:doc:`Merges and syncs from Debian </explanation/debian-merges-and-syncs>`. 
The development of planned projects for the release often begins while merging is
still underway, and the development accelerates once the package archive
is reasonably consistent and usable.

The automatic import of new package versions from Debian ends at the 
:ref:`DebianImportFreeze`.

Stabilisation and milestones (freezes)
--------------------------------------

Developers should increasingly exercise caution in making changes to Ubuntu to
ensure a stable state is reached in time for the final release date.
Archive admins incrementally restrict modifications to the Ubuntu package
archive, effectively freezing the state of the Ubuntu package archive. The
milestones when these restrictions get enabled are called "freezes".
During freezes, developers must request exceptions to approve changes. See 
:doc:`how to request a freeze exception </how-to/request-freeze-exception>`.
The release team usually posts the current Release Schedule as a Discourse
article under the `"Release" topic <https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/release/>`_.
It shows the typical order and length of the various freezes.

.. note::
    In the past, the Release Schedule was published in the Ubuntu Wiki.
    See, for example, the `release schedule of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseSchedule>`_.

.. _TestingWeeks:

Testing weeks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During a release's development phase, the release team organise testing weeks to
focus the Ubuntu community's efforts on testing Ubuntu's latest daily
:term:`ISO images <Image>` and its :term:`flavours <Ubuntu flavours>`. These
weeks are crucial for discovering bugs and getting early feedback about new
features.

.. note::
    The testing weeks replaced the older practice of alpha and beta milestones.
    For example, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) had Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1,
    and Beta 2 milestones.

    See `the email <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-release/2018-April/004434.html>`_
    that announced the process change.

.. _DebianImportFreeze:

Debian Import Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Archive admins disable the automatic import of new packages and versions of
existing packages from Debian. The import of a new package or version of an
existing package from Debian has to be requested. 

.. note::

    The general development activity is still unrestricted until the
    Feature Freeze; however, the Feature Freeze is often scheduled for the same
    day.

.. _FeatureFreeze:

Feature Freeze (FF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, Ubuntu developers should stop introducing new features,
packages, and :term:`API`/:term:`ABI` changes, and instead concentrate on
fixing bugs in the current release in development.

.. _User Interface Freeze:

User Interface Freeze (UIF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user interface should be finalised to allow documentation writers and
translators to work on a consistent target that doesn't render screenshots or
documentation obsolete.

After the user interface freeze, the following things are not allowed to change
without a freeze exception:

* User interface of individual applications that are installed by default
* Appearance of the desktop
* Distribution-specific artwork
* All user-visible strings in the desktop and applications that are installed 
  by default

.. _DocumentationStringFreeze:

Documentation String Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Documentation strings should no longer be created or modified. This freeze
ensures that the documentation can be accurately translated.

Exceptions to this rule may be considered before the release for significant and
glaring errors or exceptional circumstances.

.. _KernelFeatureFreeze:

Kernel Feature Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :term:`kernel` feature development should end at this point, and the
kernels can be considered feature-complete for the release. From now on, only
bugfix changes are expected.

.. note::
    The Kernel Feature Freeze occurs after the :ref:`FeatureFreeze` because
    the Linux Kernel is typically released upstream after the Feature Freeze.
    Additionally, the Kernel Feature Freeze is deliberately scheduled so that
    the Beta images have a fully featured kernel suitable for testing. 

.. _HardwareEnablementFreeze:

Hardware Enablement Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All new hardware enablement tasks for devices targeting the given release
should be finished, and all the respective packages should be in the Ubuntu
package archive. The release team no longer accepts changes in the Ubuntu
package archive related to supporting new image types or platforms.
This freeze ensures that any new platforms are already available for testing
of the beta images and in the weeks leading to the :ref:`FinalFreeze`.

.. note::
    The Hardware Enablement Freeze is usually scheduled for the same day as
    the Beta Freeze.

.. _BetaFreeze:

Beta Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~

In preparation for the beta release, all uploads are queued and subject to
manual approval by the release team. Changes to packages that affect beta
release images (flavours included) require the release team's approval before
uploading. Uploads for packages that do not affect images are generally
accepted as time permits.

.. tip::
    You can use the :manpage:`seeded-in-ubuntu(1)` tool, provided by the
    ``ubuntu-dev-tools`` package, to list all the current daily images
    containing a specified package or to determine whether the specified
    package is part of the supported seed. 
    
    If the list output is empty, uploading it during a freeze should be
    safe.

The freeze allows Archive Admins to fix package inconsistencies or critical
bugs quickly and in an isolated manner. Once the beta release is shipped, the 
Beta Freeze restrictions no longer apply.

.. _KernelFreeze:

Kernel Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kernel Freeze is the final date for kernel updates because they require several
lockstep actions that must be folded into the image-building process.

Exceptional circumstances may justify exemptions to the freeze at the
discretion of the release managers.

.. _NonLanguagePackTranslationDeadline:

Non-language-pack translation deadline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some translation data cannot currently be updated via the language pack
mechanism. Because these items require more disruptive integration work,
they are subject to an earlier deadline to give time to developers to manually
export translations from Launchpad and integrate them into the package.

This marks the date after which translations for such packages are not
guaranteed to be included in the final release. Depending on the package and
its maintainers workflow, they may be exported later.

Other packages can still be translated until the
:ref:`LanguagePackTranslationDeadline`.

.. _FinalFreeze:

Final Freeze
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This freeze marks an **extremely** high-caution period until the
:ref:`FinalRelease`. Only bug fixes for release-critical, security-critical or
otherwise exceptional circumstantial bugs are included in the Final Release,
which the release team and relevant section teams must confirm.

Unseeded packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Packages in :ref:`ArchiveComponents_Universe` that aren't seeded in any of the
Ubuntu flavours remain in :ref:`FeatureFreeze` because they do not affect
the release; however, when the Ubuntu package archive is frozen, fixes must be
manually reviewed and accepted by the release team members.

When the Final Release is close (~1.5 days out), developers should consider
uploading to the :ref:`proposed pocket <ArchivePockets_Proposed>`, from which
the release team cherry-picks into the
:ref:`release pocket <ArchivePockets_Release>` if circumstances allow.
All packages uploaded to the proposed pocket that do not make it into the
release pocket until the Final Release become candidates for
:ref:`StableReleaseUpdates_Summary`. Therefore, uploads to the proposed pocket
during Final Freeze should meet the requirements of Stable Release Updates if
the upload is not accepted into the release pocket. In particular, the upload
must reference at least one bug, which is used to track the stable update. 

.. note::
    If you are sure that your upload will be accepted during Final Freeze, you can
    upload directly to the release pocket, but be aware that you have to re-upload
    after Final Release if the upload gets rejected.

.. _ReleaseCandidate:

Release Candidate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The images produced during the week before the :ref:`FinalRelease` are
considered "release candidates". In an ideal world, the first release candidate
would end up being the Final Release; however, we don't live in a perfect
world, and this week is used to get rid of the last release-critical bugs and
do as much testing as possible. Until the Final Release, changes are only
permitted at the release team's discretion and will only be allowed for
high-priority bugs that might justify delaying the release.

.. _LanguagePackTranslationDeadline:

Language pack translation deadline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translations done up until this date will be included in the final release's
language packs. 

Finalisation
------------

As the final release approaches, the focus narrows to fixing "showstopper"
bugs and thoroughly validating the installation images. Every image is tested
to ensure that the installation methods work as advertised. Low-impact bugs
and other issues are deprioritised to focus developers on this effort.

This phase is vital, as severe bugs that affect the experience of booting
or installing the images must be fixed before the final release.
In contrast, ordinary bugs affecting the installed system can be fixed with
Stable Release Updates.

.. _FinalRelease:

Final Release
-------------

Once the release team declares the :ref:`ReleaseCandidate` ISO stable and names it
the "Final Release", a representative of the team announces it on the 
`ubuntu-announce mailing list <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/>`_.

.. note::
    See, for example, the `Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) release announcement <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2024-April/000301.html>`_.

.. _StableReleaseUpdates_Summary:

Stable Release Updates
----------------------

After publication of a :term:`Ubuntu Stable Release`, there may be a need
to update it or fix bugs. You can fix these newly discovered bugs and make
updates through a special process known as **Stable Release Update (SRU)**.

The SRU process ensures that any changes made to a stable release are thoroughly
vetted and tested before being made available to users. This is because many of
the users rely on the stability of the stable release for their day-to-day
operations, and any problem they experience with it can be disruptive.

The following paragraphs intend to give you a brief introduction to the SRU
process. See the decicated :external+sru:ref:`Ubuntu SRU Documentation <home>`
for more details about this process.

When are SRUs necessary?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SRUs require great caution because they're automatically recommended to a large
number of users. So, when you propose an update, there should be a strong
rationale for it. Also, the update should present a low risk of
:ref:`regressions <Regressions>`.

You can propose an SRU in the following cases:

- To fix high-impact bugs, including those that may directly cause security
  vulnerabilities, severe regressions from the previous release, or
  bugs that may directly cause loss of user data.
- To adjust to changes in the environment, server protocols, or web services.
  This ensures that Ubuntu remains compatible with evolving technologies.
- For safe cases with low regression potential but high user experience 
  improvement.
- To introduce new features in :term:`LTS releases <LTS>`, usually under strict
  conditions.
- To update commercial software in the :term:`Canonical partner archive`.
- To fix :term:`Failed to build from Source` issues.
- To fix :term:`autopkgtest` failures, usually in conjunction with other
  high-priority fixes.

See also: :external+sru:doc:`SRU requirements <explanation/requirements>`

Overview
~~~~~~~~

A typical SRU will be perfomed like this:

1. Ensure the bug is fixed in the :term:`current development release
   <Current Release in Development>` and all subsequent supported releases to
   ensure consistency across different Ubuntu versions, especially preventing
   regressions when users upgrade to newer ones.
#. Update the **existing** bug report detailing the Impact of the Bug, the Test
   Plan to verify that the bug was fixed and highlight where problems could
   occur.
#. Get the package with the SRU patch into the upload queue.
#. The SRU team will then review from the unapproved queue. When the upload is
   ready, the SRU team accepts the upload into the proposed pocket.
#. Once the builds are ready, autopkgtest are triggered. Test the binaries
   in the :term:`Ubuntu Archive` and follow up in the bug report with your 
   verification results.
#. The Ubuntu SRU Team will evaluate the testing feedback and move the package
   into :ref:`updates <ArchivePockets_Updates>` after it passes a minimum aging
   period of 7 days without regressions.

See :external+sru:ref:`how to perform an SRU <howto-perform-standard-sru>`.

Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the SRU team accepts the SRU into the proposed pocket, the SRU has to be
verified by the reporter or affected users of the SRU bug in a software 
environment that closely resembles the state after the SRU team copies the
package to the updates pocket. Generally, this will be with a system that's up
to date from the release, security, and updates pockets. It shouldn't include
other packages from the proposed or backports pocket, except commonly installed
packages built from the affected source package.

Read more about this process :external+sru:doc:`here <howto/release>`.

SRU phasing
^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a package is released to the updates pocket, the update is then phased 
so that the update is gradually made available to expanding subsets of Ubuntu
users.

Read more about this process :external+sru:ref:`here <explanation-phasing>`.

.. _Regressions:

Regressions
^^^^^^^^^^^

Regressions are unintended negative consequences that updates introduce.
They appear as new bugs or failures in previously well-functioning aspect of an 
Ubuntu release. 

Read more about regressions :external+sru:ref:`here <explanation-regressions>`
and how to handle them :external+sru:ref:`here <howto-report-regression>`.

Updates removal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a bug fixed by an update doesn't get any testing or verification feedback for
90 days, an automated call for testing comment will be made on the bug report.
If no testing occurs within an additional 15 days, totaling 105 days without any
testing, the :term:`Stable Release Managers` will remove the package from
proposed and close the bug task as ``Won't Fix``.

Also, updates will be removed from proposed if they introduce a nontrivial
regression.
