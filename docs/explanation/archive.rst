Ubuntu package archive
======================

:term:`Linux` :term:`distributions <Distribution>` like :term:`Ubuntu` use
:ref:`repositories <Repositories>` to hold :term:`packages <Package>` you can
install on target machines. Ubuntu has several repositories that anyone can
access. The **Ubuntu package archive** hosts :term:`Debian`
:term:`binary packages <Binary Package>` (``.deb`` files) and
:term:`source packages <Source Package>` (``.dsc`` files). On Ubuntu
installations, the Ubuntu package archive is configured as the default source
for the :term:`APT` package manager to download and install packages from.

.. note::

    Some of the following terminologies have only loose or informal definitions.
    Also, be aware that the terminology surrounding the Ubuntu package archive
    gets mixed up in day-to-day communications. This can be confusing, but the
    meaning is usually evident from the surrounding context once you are familiar
    with the following terminologies.

.. _Repositories:

Repositories
------------

In the context of package management, **repositories** are servers containing
sets of packages that a :term:`package manager <Package Manager>` can download
and install.

This term can refer to the Ubuntu package archive as a whole or just 
:ref:`suites <ArchiveSuite>`, :ref:`pockets <ArchivePockets>`, or
:ref:`components <ArchiveComponents>`.

.. _ArchiveSeries:

Series
------

A **series** refers to the packages that target a specific Ubuntu version. A
series is usually referred to by its :term:`code name <Codename>`.

Examples of series are: ``mantic``, ``lunar``, ``jammy``, ``focal``, ``bionic``, ``xenial``, ``trusty``.

.. note::

    In practice, the terms "Ubuntu series" and "Ubuntu release" are often used
    synonymously or are mistaken for each other. There is technically a
    difference; for example, an LTS version usually has an initial release
    (e.g. 22.04 LTS) and multiple point releases (e.g. 22.04.1 LTS, 22.04.2 LTS),
    which are all part of the same *series* (e.g. ``jammy``).

.. _ArchivePockets:

Pockets
-------

**Pockets** are package sub-repositories within the Ubuntu package archive.
Every Ubuntu series has the following pockets:

.. _ArchivePockets_Release:

release
~~~~~~~

This pocket contains the packages that an Ubuntu series was initially released
with. After the initial release of an Ubuntu series, the packages in this pocket
are not updated (not even for security-related fixes).

.. _ArchivePockets_Security:

security
~~~~~~~~

This pocket contains security-related updates to packages in the
:ref:`ArchivePockets_Release` pocket.

.. _ArchivePockets_Updates:

updates
~~~~~~~

This pocket contains non-security-related updates to packages in the
:ref:`ArchivePockets_Release` pocket.

.. _ArchivePockets_Proposed:

proposed
~~~~~~~~

This pocket is a :term:`staging environment <Staging Environment>` the Ubuntu
community can opt into, to verify the stability of any updates before they get
deployed to a broader range of consumers.

* Before the initial release of an Ubuntu series, this pocket contains
  non-security-related updates to packages in the :ref:`ArchivePockets_Release`
  pocket before they get uploaded to the :ref:`ArchivePockets_Release` pocket.
* After the initial release of an Ubuntu series, this pocket contains
  non-security-related updates to packages in the :ref:`ArchivePockets_Release`
  pocket before they get uploaded to the :ref:`ArchivePockets_Updates` pocket.

.. _ArchivePockets_Backports:

backports
~~~~~~~~~

This pocket contains packages the Ubuntu series was initially **NOT** released with.

The :doc:`backports article </explanation/backports>` provides more information
on backporting software.

.. important::

    The **backports pocket** does not come with any security support guarantee.
    The Ubuntu Security Team does not update packages in the backports pocket.
    The Ubuntu community is responsible for maintaining packages in backports
    with later patches for bug fixes and security updates.

.. _ArchiveSuite:

Suite
-----

A combination of a series and a pocket. For example:

+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+
| Suite               | Series               | Pocket                          |
+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+
| ``jammy``           | ``jammy``            | :ref:`ArchivePockets_Release`   |
+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+
| ``jammy-security``  | ``jammy``            | :ref:`ArchivePockets_Security`  |
+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+
| ``jammy-updates``   | ``jammy``            | :ref:`ArchivePockets_Updates`   |
+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+
| ``jammy-proposed``  | ``jammy``            | :ref:`ArchivePockets_Proposed`  |
+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+
| ``jammy-backports`` | ``jammy``            | :ref:`ArchivePockets_Backports` |
+---------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------+

You can see `all active suites <http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/>`_ in
the archive.

.. note::

    The ``devel`` series always mirrors the series with the code name of the
    :term:`current release in development <Current Release in Development>`.

.. _ArchiveComponents:

Components
----------

**Components** are logical subdivisions or :term:`namespaces <Namespace>` of the 
packages in a suite. The APT package manager can subscribe to the individual components
of a suite.

The packages of an Ubuntu series are categorised according to whether they are
:term:`Open Source Software` or :term:`Closed Source Software`, and whether or
not they are part of the :term:`base packages <Ubuntu Base Packages>` for a given
series. On this basis they are sorted into the components "main", "restricted",
"universe", or "multiverse", as shown in the following table:

+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
|                            | Open source software              | Closed source software              |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Ubuntu base packages**   | :ref:`ArchiveComponents_Main`     | :ref:`ArchiveComponents_Restricted` |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Community packages**     | :ref:`ArchiveComponents_Universe` | :ref:`ArchiveComponents_Multiverse` |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

:term:`Canonical` maintains the base packages and provides security updates. See
:ref:`release lifespan <UbuntuReleaseLifespan>` for more information about the
official support provided by Canonical.

For example, if you look into any of the :ref:`ArchivePockets` of the ``devel``
series (|devel-release|_, |devel-updates|_, |devel-security|_, |devel-proposed|_,
|devel-backports|_) you will see the four components (main, restricted, universe, multiverse)
as directories.

.. _ArchiveComponents_Main:

main
~~~~

This component contains open source software packages for a given series that
are supported and maintained by Canonical.

.. _ArchiveComponents_Restricted:

restricted
~~~~~~~~~~

This component contains closed source software packages for a given series that
are supported and maintained by Canonical. Packages in this component are mostly
proprietary drivers for devices and similar.

.. _ArchiveComponents_Universe:

universe
~~~~~~~~

This component contains open source software packages for a given series that are
supported and maintained by the Ubuntu community.

.. _ArchiveComponents_Multiverse:

multiverse
~~~~~~~~~~

This component contains packages (for a given series) of closed source software,
or open source software restricted by copyright or legal issues. These packages
are maintained and supported by the Ubuntu community, but because of the
restrictions, patching bugs or updates may not be possible.

.. _ArchiveMirrors:

Mirrors
-------

Every day, hundreds of thousands of people want to download and install packages
from the Ubuntu package archive. To provide a good
:term:`user experience <User Experience>`, the content of
``http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu`` gets mirrored (replicated and kept in sync)
by other servers to distribute network traffic, reduce latency, and provide redundancy,
which ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

Here is a complete list of officially recognised
`Ubuntu package archive mirrors <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors>`_.

.. note::

    There are also mirrors for the Ubuntu :term:`ISO` images (also called "CD
    images", because ISO images can be downloaded and burned to a CD to make
    installation disks.)

    You can find a complete list of officially recognised
    `Ubuntu CD mirrors <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors>`_.

Country mirrors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ubuntu package archive mirrors that provide a very reliable service in a country
can request to be the official **country mirror** for that country. Ubuntu
installations are configured by default to use the country mirror for their
selected country.

Country mirrors are accessible via the domain name format:
  
.. code:: text

    <country-code>.archive.ubuntu.com

You can see which mirror is the country mirror by doing a simple
:term:`DNS` lookup. For example:

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Finland (FI)

        .. code:: bash

            dig fi.archive.ubuntu.com +noall +answer

        .. code:: text

            fi.archive.ubuntu.com.	332	IN	CNAME	mirrors.nic.funet.fi.
            mirrors.nic.funet.fi.	332	IN	A	193.166.3.5

        Therefore, ``mirrors.nic.funet.fi`` is Finland's country mirror.

    .. tab-item:: Tunisia (TN)

        Tunisia does not have any third-party mirrors in its country. Therefore the
        Tunisia country mirror is just the primary Ubuntu package archive server
        (``archive.ubuntu.com``).

        .. code:: bash

            dig tn.archive.ubuntu.com +noall +answer

        .. code:: text

            tn.archive.ubuntu.com.	60	IN	A	185.125.190.36
            tn.archive.ubuntu.com.	60	IN	A	91.189.91.83
            tn.archive.ubuntu.com.	60	IN	A	91.189.91.82
            tn.archive.ubuntu.com.	60	IN	A	185.125.190.39
            tn.archive.ubuntu.com.	60	IN	A	91.189.91.81

        which are just the ``archive.ubuntu.com`` IP addresses:

        .. code:: bash

            dig archive.ubuntu.com +noall +answer

        .. code:: text

            archive.ubuntu.com.	1	IN	A	185.125.190.39
            archive.ubuntu.com.	1	IN	A	185.125.190.36
            archive.ubuntu.com.	1	IN	A	91.189.91.83
            archive.ubuntu.com.	1	IN	A	91.189.91.81
            archive.ubuntu.com.	1	IN	A	91.189.91.82

Package uploads
---------------

Ubuntu encourages contributions from any person in the wider community.
However, direct uploading to the Ubuntu package archive is restricted. These
general contributions need to be reviewed and uploaded by a :term:`sponsor <Sponsor>`.

See our :doc:`article on sponsoring </explanation/sponsoring>` that explains this
process in more detail.

Security update propagation
---------------------------

This section is a niche technical explanation. You can skip it if you don't feel that
this is currently relevant for you.

Because security updates contain fixes for :term:`Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures`
(CVE), it is mission critical to distribute them as fast as possible to end users.
Mirrors are a technical burden in this case, because there is a delay between the
synchronisation of a mirror and the primary Ubuntu package archive server.

In the worst case a bad actor gets informed about a CVE and can use it, before
the update reaches a target machine.

Therefore the APT package manager is configured by default (on Ubuntu) to also check
for updates from ``security.ubuntu.com``. Security updates will get uploaded here
first. If a mirror does not provide the update yet a client will download it from
``security.ubuntu.com`` instead from the mirror.

You can see this yourself if you look what the :manpage:`sources.list(5)` file contains
on your Ubuntu machine:

.. code:: bash

    cat /etc/apt/sources.list

At the end of the file you will find something similar to this:

.. code:: text

    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu SERIES-security main restricted
    # deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu SERIES-security main restricted
    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu SERIES-security universe
    # deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu SERIES-security universe
    deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu SERIES-security multiverse
    # deb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu SERIES-security multiverse

Because the :manpage:`sources.list(5)` file is read from top to bottom, the APT
package manager will download updates from the mirror first and only download it
from ``security.ubuntu.com`` if the mirror has an older version,
because the mirror has not synchronised with the primary Ubuntu package archive
server yet.

``security.ubuntu.com`` points to the same servers as ``archive.ubuntu.com`` if
you do a DNS lookup. It is used in the :manpage:`sources.list(5)` file for the
security pocket to prevent a user/script from accidentally changing it to a mirror.

Landscape repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Landscape <https://ubuntu.com/landscape>`_ is a management and administration
tool for Ubuntu. Landscape allows you to mirror :term:`APT` repositories like the
Ubuntu package archive. Although it is not directly related to the
Ubuntu package archive it can be educational to understand how APT repositories
work in general.
