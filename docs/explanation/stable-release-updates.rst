Stable Release Updates (SRU)
============================

After publication of a :term:`Ubuntu Stable Release`, there may be a need
to update it or fix bugs. You can fix these newly discovered bugs and make
updates through a special process known as Stable Release Update (SRU).

The SRU process ensures that any changes made to a stable release are thoroughly
vetted and tested before being made available to users. This is because many of
the users rely on the stability of the stable release for their day-to-day
operations, and any problem they experience with it can be disruptive.

When are Stable Release Updates necessary?
------------------------------------------

SRUs require great caution because they're automatically recommended to a large
number of users. So, when you propose an update, there should be a strong
rationale for it. Also, the update should present a low risk of
:ref:`regressions <Regressions>`.

You can propose an SRU in the following cases:

- To fix high-impact bugs, including those that may directly cause security
  vulnerabilities, severe regressions from the previous release, or
  bugs that may directly cause loss of user data.
- To adjust to changes in the environment, server protocols, or web services.
  This ensures that Ubuntu remains compatible with evolving technologies.
- For safe cases with low regression potential but high user experience 
  improvement.
- To introduce new features in :term:`LTS releases <LTS>`, usually under strict
  conditions.
- To update commercial software in the :term:`Canonical partner archive`.
- To fix :term:`Failed to build from Source` issues.
- To fix :term:`autopkgtest` failures, usually in conjunction with other
  high-priority fixes.

Low priority and Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) uploads
------------------------------------------------------------

You can stage and bundle low-priority uploads with a future SRU or security
update. These uploads may include updates that fix bugs that don't affect users
at runtime.

For uploads to stable releases in their :term:`ESM` period, please prepare the 
SRU bug, then contact the :term:`Ubuntu ESM Team`.

General requirements
--------------------

The general requirements for SRU are designed to ensure the stability and 
reliability of :ref:`Ubuntu releases <UbuntuReleases>`.

To prevent future regressions when users upgrade to newer Ubuntu versions, bugs
should be fixed in the
:term:`current development release <Current Release in Development>` before
being considered for an SRU.

Also, all subsequent supported releases should be fixed at the same time. This
ensures consistency across different Ubuntu versions. There are two exceptions
to this requirement. These exceptions apply only to bug fixes, not to hardware
enablement or new features:

- When there are two current subsequent interim releases, fixing only the most
  recent one is acceptable. This provides an upgrade path for users facing the
  regression.
- When resources are limited, it's recommended but not a strict requirement to
  fix all subsequent interim releases. If you're unable to fix all subsequent 
  interim releases, mark the bug tasks for those releases as ``Won't Fix`` and
  explicitly state your intention not to fix them. The :term:`Ubuntu SRU Team` 
  may accept this at their discretion. Failure to communicate your intentions 
  may result in additional review.

SRU procedures
--------------

The following steps outline the process for submitting and managing an
SRU in Ubuntu:

1. Ensure that the bug is fixed in the current development release and that its
   status is marked as ``Fix Released``. If the source package has changed names
   between releases, add the new source package as ``Also affecting``
   in the bug report.
2. Don't create a meta-bug with a title like ``Please SRU this`` instead of 
   using existing bug reports. This approach is redundant and lacks transparency
   for the original bug reporters, whose feedback is important for verification.
   Such meta-bugs will be invalidated by the Ubuntu SRU Team, and the 
   corresponding uploads will be rejected from the queue.
3. Ensure that the bug report for the issue is public. If the bug has been 
   reported privately and can't be published, create a separate public bug 
   report in :term:`Launchpad` and transfer as much information as can be 
   published.
4. Update the bug report with the following sections:

  - **Impact**: Explain the bug's effect on users and the reasons for 
    backporting the fix to the stable release. Optionally, include an 
    explanation of how the upload fixes the bug.
  - **Test Plan**: Provide detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug.
    These instructions should be clear enough for someone unfamiliar with the 
    package to verify the fix.
  - **Where Problems Could Occur**: Highlight potential areas where
    regressions might happen. This section should show that
    potential risks have been considered. It should also provide additional
    test cases to ensure there are no regressions.

5. Prepare the SRU upload, attach a ``debdiff`` to the bug, and request
   sponsorship by subscribing ``ubuntu-sponsors`` to the bug. The upload should
   have the correct release in the changelog header, a detailed and 
   user-readable changelog and no unrelated changes. If you can upload directly,
   use ``dput`` as normal. Once uploaded, change the bug status to
   ``In Progress``. The status will be automatically updated to 
   ``Fix Committed`` once accepted into ``release-proposed``.
6. Ensure that the version number doesn't conflict with any future versions in
   other Ubuntu releases. Also, include a reference to the SRU bug
   number in the changelog using the ``LP: #NNNNNN`` format, and only reference
   public bugs.
7. Once the Ubuntu SRU Team reviews and accepts your upload, test the binaries
   in the :term:`Ubuntu Archive` and follow up in the bug report with your 
   verification results. The Ubuntu SRU Team will evaluate the testing feedback 
   and move the package into :ref:`updates <ArchivePockets_Updates>` after it 
   passes a minimum aging period of 7 days.
8. Subscribe to the bugmail of the package in Launchpad, and monitor Launchpad 
   for bug reports relating to the update for at least one week. If you notice 
   and confirm any regression, document it in a bug report marked with an
   ``Importance: critical`` label.

SRU phasing
-----------

Once a package is released to ``updates``, the update is then phased so that the
update is gradually made available to expanding subsets of Ubuntu users.

Initially, the ``Phased-Update-Percentage`` is set to 10%, with a job running 
every 6 hours to monitor for regressions. If no issues are detected, the update
percentage increments by 10% until it reaches 100%. So an update will become
fully phased after 54 hours. If a regression is found, the update is halted and
the ``Phased-Update-Percentage`` is set to 0%. This will then cause supported
package managers not to install the update.

Investigating halted phased updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To investigate why phasing stopped, use the phased updates report.

When investigating an increased rate of crashes, focus on the crashes with the
highest number of occurrences. Examine the occurrences table to determine if 
these crashes are happening more frequently with the updated version of the 
package. If they are, investigate the cause and address the crash in a follow-up
SRU. If not, contact the Ubuntu SRU Team about overriding the crash report.

For new errors, verify that they're indeed new by reviewing the versions table 
and checking the ``Traceback`` or ``Stacktrace`` to determine if the error 
originates from the updated package or an underlying library. If you believe the
error wasn't caused by the update, you can contact the Ubuntu SRU Team to
override the crash.

Overriding halted phased updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overriding halted phasing is similar to handling :term:`autopkgtest` failures.
The phased update machinery uses a file named ``phased-update-overrides.txt``, a
simple CSV file containing lines of the form ``source package``, ``version``, 
and ``$THING_TO_IGNORE``.

``$THING_TO_IGNORE`` can either be an ``errors.ubuntu.com`` problem URL to 
ignore or ``increased-rate``.

.. _Verification:

Verification
------------

SRU verification should be done in a software environment that closely resembles
that which will exist after the package is copied to ``updates``. Generally, 
this will be with a system that's up to date from 
:ref:`release <ArchivePockets_Release>`, 
:ref:`security <ArchivePockets_Security>`, and ``updates``. It shouldn't include
other packages from :ref:`proposed <ArchivePockets_Proposed>` or
:ref:`backports <ArchivePockets_Backports>`, with one exception: other packages
built from the affected source package must be updated if they're generally
installed.

If the fix is sufficient, the :term:`SRU Verification Team` will update the bug
status to ``In Progress``, and change the  ``verification-needed-$RELEASE`` tag
to ``verification-failed-$RELEASE``. If the fix is sufficent, the SRU 
Verification Team will tag it as ``verification-done-$RELEASE``.

If you encounter a regression in a package uploaded to proposed, do the 
following:

1. File a bug report describing the nature of the regression.
#. Tag the bug as ``regression-proposed``.
#. Ask a :term:`Bug supervisor` to target the bug to the appropriate Ubuntu 
   releases.
#. Follow up on the SRU bug report referenced from the package changelog, 
   pointing to the new bug. If there is more than one bug in the SRU changelog,
   follow up to the bug that is most closely related to the regression.
#. Set the ``verification-failed-$RELEASE`` tag on the corresponding SRU bug
   report.

.. note::

   ``$RELEASE`` represents the release name of your upload.

Packages accepted into proposed automatically trigger related ``autopkgtests``.

If an SRU upload triggers an ``autopkgtests`` regression, the target package 
will not be released into updates until the issue is resolved. Once the tests
are completed, the pending SRU page provides links to any failures noticed for
the selected upload. It's the responsibility of the uploader or the person 
performing update verification to ensure that the upload doesn't cause any 
regressions, both in manual and automated testing.

.. _Regressions:

Regressions
-----------

Regressions are unintended negative consequences that updates introduce. They
appear as new bugs or failures in previously well-functioning aspect of an 
Ubuntu release. 

If a package update introduces a regression that makes it through the
:ref:`verification <Verification>` process to ``updates``, file a bug report
about the issue and add the tag ``regression-update`` to the bug.

For regressions that only apply to the package in proposed, follow up on the bug
with a detailed explanation and tag it with ``regression-proposed``.

Regression tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To minimise the risk of regressions being introduced through SRU, 
:term:`Canonical` will test each proposed kernel.

The Ubuntu Platform QA team will perform ``Depth Regression Testing`` on a 
minimal set of hardware that represents the different flavours of Ubuntu 
editions and architectures. This test verifies that the update didn't introduce
hardware-independent regressions.

The Ubuntu HW Certification team will perform ``Breadth Hardware Testing`` on
release-certified hardware. This test verifies that the proposed kernel can be
successfully installed on the latest release, that network access is functional,
and that no other functionality critical for Update Manager is missing.

Updates removal
---------------

If a bug fixed by an update doesn't get any testing or verification feedback for
90 days, an automated call for testing comment will be made on the bug report.
If no testing occurs within an additional 15 days, totaling 105 days without any
testing, the :term:`Stable Release Managers` will remove the package from
proposed and close the bug task as ``Won't Fix``.

Also, updates will be removed from proposed if they introduce a nontrivial
regression.
