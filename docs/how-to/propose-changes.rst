Propose changes
===============

This guide walks you through the process for proposing changes to Ubuntu. The process is straightforward. When you find a problem, you obtain the code, work on a solution, test the fix, push your changes to :term:`Launchpad`, and then request a review and merge.

.. attention::

    There are information placed within angle brackets in this guide. Ensure you replace them with the appropriate values. For example, replace ``<package-name>`` with the name of the package you are working on.

Find a bug to fix
-----------------

Start by identifying an issue to work on. This can be a bug you encountered while using an application, a problem described in a bug report, or a known issue in the Ubuntu community.

You can also explore known bugs using these resources:

- `Bitesize bugs on Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize>`_: These are small, well-scoped bugs that are great for new contributors.
- `One Hundred Papercuts <https://launchpad.net/hundredpapercuts>`_: This resource focuses on fixing minor bugs that negatively affect the user experience.
- `Launchpad's bug tracker <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu>`_ and `Debian's bug trackers <https://www.debian.org/Bugs/>`_: These contain issue reports for Ubuntu and Debian packages.


Evaluate the bug report
-----------------------

Once you find a bug report on Launchpad that you want to work on, the next step is to evaluate the bug.

Read the bug description carefully and look for:

- steps to reproduce the problem
- crash logs or terminal output
- details about the affected version and package
- attached ``.crash`` files or `Apport crash files <https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/PackageFixing.md#evaluate-the-bug>`_

For example, this `bug report <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/postfix/+bug/1753470>`_ shows a segmentation fault in ``postconf`` on Ubuntu 18.04. It includes logs from ``/var/log/kern.log``, shell commands that reproduce the issue, and metadata about the system environment. This information helps confirm whether the bug still affects current versions and if the report is complete.

If the bug includes a ``.crash`` file, extract and inspect the stack trace. Use the information to better understand where the failure occurred in the code.

For more details, see `Evaluate the bug <https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/PackageFixing.md#evaluate-the-bug>`_.

Identify the source package
---------------------------

After selecting a bug to fix, the first step is to identify the source package that contains the code related to the issue.

Start by identifying the name of the binary package. If you know the path or part of the filename of the affected program, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt-file find <filename-or-path>

.. note::

    Replace ``<filename-or-path>`` with either the full path or part of the filename.

    For example, both of the following work:

    .. code-block:: bash

        apt-file find /usr/games/bumprace
        apt-file find bumprace

Running the command returns an output similar to:

.. code-block:: text

    bumprace: /usr/games/bumprace

In the preceding output, the part before the colon is the name of the binary package.

After identifying the name of the binary package, the next step is to find the source package. Use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    apt show <binary-package-name>

.. note::

    Replace ``<binary-package-name>`` with the actual name of the binary package.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        apt show bumprace

Now check the output for the ``Source`` field. This field indicates the name of the source package.

It's possible for the name of a binary package to be the same as its source package. If this is the case, then the ``apt show <binary-package-name>`` command won't display the ``Source`` field in its output. In such cases, you can assume the source package name is the same as the binary package name.

Check if the bug has been fixed
-------------------------------

Once you identify the source package, make sure the issue still exists. A fix may already exist in a newer Ubuntu release, in Debian, or upstream. Checking first will save time and avoid duplicate work.

Follow the steps in the following subsections to check whether the problem has already been addressed.

Check if the bug is fixed in a newer Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``rmadison`` to review the versions of the package available across Ubuntu releases.

.. code-block:: bash

    rmadison <package-name>

This shows you which versions are available in different Ubuntu series. Look for a newer version than the one you are using. If a fix was introduced in a later version, check the changelog or commit history to verify.

To review changes, clone the package with `git ubuntu`:

.. code-block:: bash

    git ubuntu clone postfix postfix
    cd postfix
    git log -b pkg/ubuntu/<ubuntu-series>

Look through the commit messages and patch files to identify if the issue has been resolved.

Check if the bug is fixed in Debian
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian is a key source for Ubuntu packages. Search for bug reports or patches applied there.

First, check Debian’s bug tracker using the URL ``https://bugs.debian.org/src:<package-name>``.

To inspect changes in more detail, find the source repository used by Debian. You can do this in a few ways:

- use ``debcheckout``:

.. code-block:: shell

    debcheckout <package-name>
    cd <package-name>
    git log

- look for the ``Vcs-Git`` and ``Vcs-Browser`` fields from the ``apt showsrc`` command output. These point to the package's source code repository and its web interface:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt showsrc --only-source <package-name>

Now, look for commit messages that describe fixes relevant to your issue. If a bug number is referenced, open the link and review the context.

Check if the bug is fixed upstream
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the problem originates from the software itself and not the package, investigate upstream. Each project has its own bug tracker and code repository.

You can find the upstream project by doing the following:

- search the package homepage listed by running the command ``apt show <package>``
- look up the project through web search if no homepage is set
- check the metadata in the package description or Debian tracker

Once you find the upstream repository, do the following:

1. look through open and closed issues
#. search the commit history for relevant fixes
#. clone the upstream Git repository if available and inspect the logs

If upstream has resolved the problem, consider if that version has reached Debian or Ubuntu. If not, you may propose packaging the new version or backporting the patch.

Offer to help
-------------

Once you confirm the issue still exists, a bug report is open, and no one is working on it, you can offer to help. This step signals your interest in resolving the issue and helps prevent duplicated efforts.

Start by commenting on the bug report in Launchpad. Let others know that you intend to work on the issue. Include any relevant details you have, such as:

- when and how the bug occurred
- how you plan to fix the issue, or what you've tried so far
- any testing you’ve done or plan to do

If the bug doesn't yet exist in Launchpad, create a new bug report. Provide a clear title and description. Explain how the issue can be reproduced, and add logs or screenshots if helpful.

Get the source code
-------------------

Once you're assigned to the bug, get the source code for the affected package. You can get the source code using any of these four methods:

- ``git-ubuntu``
- ``pull-pkg``
- ``apt-get source``
- ``dget``

For detailed instructions on using these methods to get the source code, see :ref:`get-package-source`.

Create a patch to fix the issue
-------------------------------

You may need to create a patch to make changes to a package. Start by checking where your changes are located. If your changes are only within the ``debian/`` directory, for example, in ``debian/control``, you don't need to create a patch. However, if you changed upstream source code, that is anything outside ``debian/``, then you must create a patch and include it in ``debian/patches``.

There are two main methods for creating patches for Ubuntu packages. The method you choose will depend on the workflow that the package source uses:

- If the package uses **quilt**, use the ``quilt`` tool to create and manage patches. To learn how to create a patch using ``quilt``, see `Making a patchfile <https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/DebianPatch.md>`_.
- If the package is maintained using ``git-ubuntu``, commit your changes directly in Git.

Document the fix
----------------

It’s important to document your changes so future developers can understand your reasoning and assumptions without having to guess.

Explain your changes in the ``debian/changelog`` file. This file tracks every change uploaded to Ubuntu or Debian, and future developers rely on it to understand what changed, where it happened, and why.

Run the following command to create a new changelog entry:

.. code-block:: bash

    dch -i

This command generates a new entry and opens your text editor. The top and bottom lines will be filled out for you automatically. The top line includes the package name, version, Ubuntu release, and urgency. The bottom line shows your name, email, and a timestamp.

You should also write a short and informative message between the top and bottom lines. This message should include:

- where you made the change, such as file or component
- what the change does
- why you made the change
- link to the Launchpad bug or mailing list discussion, if available

An example of the changelog entry is as follows:

.. code-block:: text

    my-package <version> UNRELEASED; urgency=low

    * fix crash in system monitor when reading temperature sensors
        - updated <script.py> to handle missing sensor values
        - added error handling to prevent crashes

    -- name <name@example.com>  Tue, 13 May 2025 15:42:10 +0000

Reference Launchpad bugs like this:

.. code-block:: text

    LP: #<bug-number>

This ensures the bug will close automatically when the fix is uploaded.

Test the fix
------------

Run package tests to check that your change doesn't introduce regressions. Ubuntu uses :term:`autopkgtest` to automate this process. You can run tests in several ways: 

- in a local virtual machine (VM)
- through a :term:`Personal Package Archive` (PPA) on Launchpad
- in a container

For local testing, use a VM or container. The `autopkgtest` tool builds test images and runs the tests in an isolated environment. Use this method when you want to debug failures or verify changes before uploading to a PPA. If your testbed needs to reboot or be isolated, use a VM or container as defined in the package’s ``debian/tests/control`` file.

You can also use PPA-based method whenever possible. It produces results closest to what Launchpad runs for archive packages. After uploading your package to a PPA and building it, you can trigger tests using the ``PPA`` tool from ``ppa-dev-tools``. You will need special permissions to launch these tests. Ask for help in the ``#ubuntu-devel`` IRC channel if needed.

To learn how to set up and run these test methods, see `Running package tests <https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/PackageTests.md>`_.

Submit the fix
--------------

Once you've documented and saved your changes in a new changelog entry, run ``debuild``:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild -S -d

The command signs the changes in the file. After that, you can submit your fix by opening a merge proposal. For details on how to do this, see the section on `Merge proposal <https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/MergeProposal.md>`_ in the Ubuntu Maintainer's Handbook.

In many cases, Debian would benefit from the fix as well. Submitting to Debian is considered best practice because it ensures that a wider audience receives the fix. You can submit the fix to Debian by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    submittodebian

Running the preceding command walks you through a series of steps to ensure the bug report ends up in the correct place. Be sure to review the diff again to confirm it doesn’t include unrelated changes you made earlier.

Also, ensure you add a clear description of the fix to the inclusion request.

If everything goes well, you will get an email from Debian's bug tracking system with more information. This may take a few minutes.

Sometimes it’s best to get your fix included in Debian first. It will then flow down to Ubuntu automatically. In that case, skip the following steps.

For security updates or updates to stable releases, the fix might already be in Debian or intentionally ignored. In these cases, follow the process described here.

.. link to the article on Security and stable release updates.

If you're doing a security or stable release update, read the article on Security and stable release updates.

You can also follow this process when dealing with Ubuntu-only packages that don’t build correctly, or with issues that affect Ubuntu specifically.

If you're submitting your fix to Ubuntu, generate a ``debdiff``. A ``debdiff`` shows the difference between two Debian source packages. The command is also called ``debdiff``, and it comes from the ``devscripts`` package. For full details, see the `manpages for debdiff <https://manpages.debian.org/testing/devscripts/debdiff.1.en.html>`_.

To compare two source packages, use the ``.dsc`` files as arguments:

.. code-block:: bash

    debdiff <package_name>_1.0-1.dsc <package_name>_1.0-1ubuntu1.dsc

Compare the original ``.dsc`` file with the one you generated after making your changes. This will generate a patch that your sponsor can then apply locally by using ``patch -p1 < /path/to/debdiff``. In this case, pipe the output of the ``debdiff`` command to a file and attach it to the bug report:

.. code-block:: bash

    debdiff <package_name>_1.0-1.dsc <package_name>_1.0-1ubuntu1.dsc > 1-1.0-1ubuntu1.debdiff

The format of the filename shown in ``1-1.0-1ubuntu1.debdiff`` has some meaning:

1. ``1-`` tells the sponsor that this is the first revision of your patch.
#. ``1.0-1ubuntu1`` shows the version you are working on.
#. ``.debdiff`` makes it clear that it’s a ``debdiff`` file.

While this format is optional, it works well and you can use it.

Next, go to the bug report on Launchpad. Log in, then click **Add attachment or patch** near the comment box. Attach the ``debdiff`` and leave a comment. Explain how the patch can be applied and what testing you've done.

Here’s an example:

.. code-block:: text

    This is a debdiff for Artful applicable to 1.0-1. I built this in pbuilder and it builds successfully, and I installed it, the patch works as intended.

Mark the attachment as a patch. This will notify the Ubuntu Sponsors team. Also, make sure you're subscribed to the bug report so you get updates.

You will usually get a review within a few hours to a few weeks. If it takes too long, join ``#ubuntu-motu`` on Libera Chat and ask for help. Stay in the channel until someone responds. They will guide you through your next steps.

After review, the sponsor might upload your fix, request changes, or reject it. If changes are needed, follow the same steps and submit a new ``debdiff`` to the bug. If the fix is rejected because it's not a fit for Ubuntu, you might need to send it to Debian instead.

If you have questions, email ``ubuntu-motu@lists.ubuntu.com`` or join ``#ubuntu-motu`` on Libera Chat. You will find people who share your passion for improving open source and making the world better.
