Patch management
================

This article demonstrates how to manage the :term:`patches <Patch>` of a
:term:`source package <Source package>` in the ``3.0 (quilt)`` format.

See the :doc:`patches explanation article </explanation/patches>` for more
background information about patches in the context of :term:`Ubuntu`.

.. note::

    If the format is ``3.0 (native)``, this article is not of interest for you and
    simply write your changes to the files. There is no need to explicitly create
    and track a patch for native packages.
    See the :doc:`package model </explanation/package-model>` article for more
    information about package formats.

As the source package format implies, we will use the :manpage:`quilt(1)` tool
to manage the patches of a source package. Quilt manages patches like a
:term:`Stack`. It maintains a list of patches (also called "series")
that get applied one after another from top to bottom in the order
they are listed in :file:`debian/patches/series`, excluding lines starting with ``#``.

.. important::

    Quilt will create a ``.pc/`` directory at the source package root
    directory. This is the location where Quilt will store control files
    similar to the ``.git/`` folder of a :term:`Git` repository.

    Before you commit any changes (e.g., with :term:`git-ubuntu`) or attempt
    to build the source package, **do not forget to unapply all patches and
    delete the directory:**

    .. code-block:: none
        
       quilt pop -a && rm -r .pc

    You can avoid removing ``.pc`` if it exists in the
    ``.gitignore`` file, or if you can otherwise avoid it when running
    ``git add``.

Prerequisites
-------------

If you haven't already, install :manpage:`quilt(1)`:

.. include:: /reuse/snippets/quilt/setup.rst

List patches
------------

List all available patches:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt series

This will also color code which patches are applied (green), which patch is the
latest applied patch (yellow) and which patches are unapplied (white).

List applied patches:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt applied

Display the topmost applied patch:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt top

List unapplied patches:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt unapplied

.. note::

    Quilt patches are applied from top to bottom in the order they are listed.

.. _ApplyPatches:

Apply patches
-------------

Apply the next patch:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt push

Apply all patches:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt push -a

Apply the next ``N`` patches

.. code-block:: none

    quilt push N

Apply all patches until (including) a specific patch:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt push PATCH-NAME

This can also be the path of the patch (allowing for auto-completion):

.. code-block:: none

    quilt push debian/series/PATCH-NAME

Unapply patches
---------------

This works similar to applying patches.

Unapply the patch on top:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt pop

Unapply all patches:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt pop -a

Unapply the ``N`` topmost applied patches

.. code-block:: none

    quilt pop N

Unapply all patches until (excluding) a specific patch:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt pop PATCH-NAME

This can also be the path of the patch (allowing for auto-completion):

.. code-block:: none

    quilt pop debian/series/PATCH-NAME

.. _VerifyPatches:

Verify patches
--------------

Now that we know how to apply and unapply patches we can verify if all patches
apply and unapply cleanly. This can be useful when you merge changes from
Debian into an Ubuntu package and want to check if everything is still in
order.

1. We verify that all patches apply cleanly:
   
   .. code-block:: none
    
       quilt push -a

2. We verify that all patches unapply cleanly:
   
   .. code-block:: none
        
       quilt pop -a

3. (optional) We remove the Quilt control file folder:
   
   .. code-block:: none
        
       rm -r .pc

Show details about a patch file
-------------------------------

Print the header of the topmost applied or specified patch:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt header [PATCH-NAME]

Print the list of files that the topmost applied or specified patch changes:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt files [PATCH-NAME]

Print the changes by the topmost applied or specified patch to the specified file(s)
in a diff format. If no files are specified, all files that are changes are included.

.. code-block:: none

    quilt diff [-P PATCH-NAME] [FILE-PATH ...]


Rename a patch file
-------------------

Rename the topmost applied or specified patch:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt rename [-P PATCH-NAME] NEW-PATCH-NAME

Remove a patch file
-------------------

Remove the topmost applied or specified patch from the :file:`debian/patches/series` file.
Use ``-r`` to also delete the patch file from the :file:`debian/patches` directory:

.. code-block:: none

    quilt delete [-r] [PATCH-NAME]

Generate a patch file
---------------------

1. Create a new patch after the topmost applied patch:

   .. code-block:: none
    
      quilt new PATCH-NAME

   .. note::

      It is best practice to read the existing patch-file-names in :file:`debian/patches`
      and ensure your new patch name is consistent with the existing ones.

2. Edit files outside the :file:`debian/` directory by following the same steps as 
   outlined by the following section :ref:`EditPatches`.

.. _EditPatches:

Edit a patch file
-----------------

1. Apply all patches until the patch we want to edit:
   
   .. code-block:: none

       quilt push PATCH-NAME

2. There are multiple approaches how to edit the patch file:

   - Edit the patch header:
  
     .. code-block:: none
      
        quilt header -e
  
     .. tip::
  
        If the patch does not already have a header and you want to add one; add the
        ``--dep3`` flag to insert a :term:`DEP 3` patch header template:
  
        .. code-block:: none
      
           quilt header --dep3 -e
  
     .. tip::
  
        See the :doc:`DEP 3 -- Patch file headers reference </reference/patchfile-headers>`
        which lists and briefly explains standard DEP 3 compliant fields and shows sample
        DEP 3 compliant headers. 

   - Edit specific file(s) with a text editor after adding the changes to the patch file:

     .. code-block:: none
         
        quilt edit FILE-PATH ...

     .. note::

        Opens the files in ``$EDITOR`` -- this is usually your default terminal editor.

   - Edit specific file(s) manually (without immediately opening an editor):

     a. Check which files are already changed by the patch file:
  
        .. code-block:: none
  
            quilt files 
  
     b. If you want to edit file(s) that the patch currently does NOT change 
        -- add these files to the patch before editing them: 
     
        .. code-block:: none
  
            quilt add FILE-PATH ...
  
        .. note::
  
           You can directly edit files which are already changed by the patch.
  
        .. tip::
  
           To see the changes of the patch file to a specific file:
  
           .. code-block:: none
  
              quilt diff FILE-PATH

           To see the changes you made of the patch file:
  
           .. code-block:: none
  
              quilt diff -z

     c. Save the changes to the patch file:

        .. code-block:: none
    
            quilt refresh
        
   - Delete the changes of a patch to specific file(s):

     .. code-block:: none
         
        quilt remove FILE-PATH ...

3. (recommended) If there are patches after the patch you have edited --
   :ref:`verify that all patches still apply cleanly <VerifyPatches>`.


Import a patch file
-------------------

Insert patch files following the current topmost applied patch: 

.. code-block:: none

    quilt import PATCH-FILE-PATH ...

.. important::

    The patch files have to be outside the :file:`debian/patches/` directory.

.. note::

    The imported patches do not get applied automatically. You must
    :ref:`apply the patches <ApplyPatches>` after importing them.
