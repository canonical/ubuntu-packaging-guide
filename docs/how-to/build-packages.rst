Build packages
==============

In Ubuntu, packages can be built in several ways, depending on the intended
artifacts. We'll cover the following types of builds:
* Source-only
* Binary-only (using installed build dependencies)
* Binary-only (using sbuild for a clean environment)
* Source and binary (using sbuild for a clean environment)

In Ubuntu, only source uploads are permitted to PPAs or the archive. That
being said, it is best practice to perform a local build and iron out any
potential issues prior to uploading it to any archive.

Prerequisites
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install sbuild debhelper ubuntu-dev-tools piuparts

All of the following sections assume you have already fetched the packaging
and are in the same directory as :file:`debian/`.

For :manpage:`sbuild(1)`, follow the instructions on the Debian and Ubuntu
sbuild pages as linked in the Resources section.

What is debuild?
----------------

:manpage:`debuild(1)` (short for :manpage:`dpkg-buildpackage(1)`) is
the tool used to build Debian packages. It is part of the
:manpage:`debhelper(7)` package and written in Perl.

In Ubuntu, we maintain a delta for the `debhelper` package. Therefore,
packages built on Debian may be slightly different than packages built on
Ubuntu.

Source-Only Builds
------------------

To build a source package *without* including the upstream tarball, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild -S -d

To build a source package *with* the upstream tarball, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild -S -d -sa

To build a source package without running Lintian, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild --no-lintian -S -d

.. note::

    The `--no-lintian` flag will only work in this case if it is first.

To build a source package without running :manpage:`dh_clean(1)`, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild -S -d -nc

.. note::

    This tends to fix failures regarding missing build dependencies.

To build a source package without a cryptographic signature (not recommended), run:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild -S -d -us -uc

Local Binary-Only Builds
------------------------

This is really only useful for packages you need to test locally, and/or
packages with minimal build dependencies. You would otherwise use :manpage:`sbuild(1)`
as discussed in a later section.

To do a binary-only build of a package, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    debuild -b

sbuild-based Builds
------------------------

This is the standard way of building a package for Ubuntu. All of the Debian
and Ubuntu infrastructure use :manpage:`sbuild(1)`, so it is beneficial to
learn how to use it. For more information on setting up :manpage:`sbuild(1)`,
please refer to the wiki links in the Resources section.

To do a binary-only build of a package using sbuild, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sbuild -c <RELEASE>-<ARCH>[-shm]

.. note::

    It is possible to use `-d` instead of `-c`, but that causes the produced
    files to contain the entire chroot name (<RELEASE>-<ARCH>[-shm]) instead
    of just <RELEASE>. An example chroot name is `noble-amd64-shm`.

To explicitly run Lintian following the build:

.. code-block:: bash

    sbuild -c <RELEASE>-<ARCH>[-shm] --run-lintian [--lintian-opts="-EvIiL +pedantic"]

To build a package without running :manpage:`dh_clean(1)`, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sbuild -c <RELEASE>-<ARCH>[-shm] --no-clean-source

To build both a binary *and* a source package with one sbuild run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sbuild -c <RELEASE>-<ARCH>[-shm] -s

.. note::

    Launchpad rejects uploads which contains both binaries and sources,
    however this is required for uploads to the Debian NEW queue. That being
    said, uploads to Debian with binaries `will not migrate to Testing <https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2019/07/msg00002.html>`.

Here is a complete, working example of running the autopkgtest following the build:

.. code-block:: bash

    sbuild -c noble-amd64-shm --run-autopkgtest --autopkgtest-virt-server=qemu --autopkgtest-virt-server-opt="/path/to/autopkgtest-noble-amd64.img" --autopkgtest-opt="--apt-pocket=proposed=src:qt6-base" --autopkgtest-opt="-U" --autopkgtest-opt="--ram-size=12000" --autopkgtest-opt="--setup-commands='apt-get -y install aptitude && aptitude -t noble-proposed -y install qt6-base-dev=6.8.1+dfsg-0ubuntu1'"

(Many other backends are available, including an schroot-based backend.)
