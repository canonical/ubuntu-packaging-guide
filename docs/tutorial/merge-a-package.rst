Merge a package from Debian
===========================

This article is still work in progress. You can use the
`Ubuntu Maintainer Handbook <https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-maintainers-handbook/blob/main/PackageMerging.md#build-source-package>`_
in the meantime.

.. note::
    Be aware that the Ubuntu Maintainer Handbook was written for server team
    and not a general audience.
