    Application Binary Interface
        Defines how two binary applications interface eachother like calling conventions,
        data type sizes, and system call interfaces, ensuring compatibility and proper
        communication between different parts of a software system, such as libraries,
        executables, and the :term:`Operating System`. *Application Binary Interfaces*
        are crucial for enabling software components compiled on different systems
        to work together seamlessly.

        .. warning::

            Do not confuse with :term:`Application Programming Interface` (:term:`API`)!

    Application Programming Interface
        An *Application Programming Interface* (API), is a set of rules that allows
        different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines
        the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange
        information, perform specific tasks, or access the functionality of another
        software component, such as an :term:`Operating System`, library, or online
        service. *APIs* enable developers to build upon existing software and create
        new applications by providing a standardized way to interact with external
        systems, services, or libraries without needing to understand their internal
        workings.

        In general, a software *distribution* (also called *"distro"*) is a set of
        software components that is distributed as a whole to users.

        Usually people think specifically of :term:`Linux` *distributions*. A :term:`Linux`
        *distribution* (or distro), is a complete :term:`Operating System` based on the
        :term:`Linux` :term:`Kernel`. It includes essential system components, software
        applications, and :term:`Package Management Tools <Package Manager>`, tailored
        to a specific purpose or user preferences. :term:`Linux` distributions vary
        in features, desktop environments, and software :term:`Repositories <Repository>`,
        allowing users to choose the one that best suits their needs.

        copying its :term:`Source Code` to evolve separately, potentially with different
        goals, features, or contributors.

    Namespace
        A concept in computer science and software development that defines a scope
        or context in which identifiers (such as variable names, functions, or classes)
        are unique and distinct. It helps prevent naming conflicts and organizes
        code elements into separate compartments. Namespaces are commonly used in
        programming languages to group and categorize code, making it more manageable
        and maintainable. They play a crucial role in encapsulation and modularity,
        allowing developers to create reusable and organized code structures.
        Namespaces are particularly important in larger software projects where
        numerous components and libraries need to coexist without clashing with
        each other's names.

    Signature
        A digital signature is a cryptographic record that verifies the authenticity
        and integrity of data.

        Every :term:`Package` in the :term:`Ubuntu Archive` is digitally signed,
        enabling users to detect data corruption during the download or unwanted/malicious
        modifications. Furthermore, some :term:`Upstream` projects sign their releases,
        which lets Ubuntu :term:`Maintainers <Maintainer>` and users of the corresponding
        packages verify that the :term:`Source Code` is from the developers of the
        upstream project.

        The tool :manpage:`gpg(1)` is commonly used to create and modify digital
        signatures. Further information can be found in the

    Stack
        In computer science, a **Stack** is a data-structure that can store a
        collection of elements linearly with two primary operations:

        - "Push": adds an element to the collection
        - "Pop": removes the most recently added element in the collection

        Stack implementatuons also often have a "Peak" operation to see the most
        recently added element in the collection without removing it.

        The name **Stack** stems from the analogy of items "stacked" ontop of
        eachother like a stack of plates where you have to remove the plates
        above to access the plates below.

    tarball
        A file in the :manpage:`tar(5)` archive format, which collects any number of
        files, directories, and other file system objects (symbolic links, device nodes, etc.)
        into a single stream of bytes. The format was originally designed to be used with
        tape drives, but nowadays it is widely used as a general packaging mechanism.

        See also: :term:`orig tarball`

    Text Encoding
        **Text encoding** refers to the method or schema used to represent and store
        text characters in a digital format. It involves assigning numerical codes
        (typically binary) to each character in a character set, which allows computers
        to process and display text. 

        For example, ``ASCII`` and ``UTF-8`` are commonly used text encoding formats.

        The choice of a text encoding format is essential for ensuring proper character
        representation, especially when dealing with different languages and special
        characters.

    Ubuntu
        The word *"ubuntu"* is derived from the pronunciation of an an ancient African word

        us that *'I am what I am because of who we all are'*.

        The *Ubuntu* :term:`Operating System` tries to bring that spirit to the world of
        computers and software. The *Ubuntu* :term:`Distribution` is a :term:`Debian`-based

        Between 2004 and 2012, :term:`Ubuntu` releases were planned during regularly scheduled
        summits, where the greater :term:`Ubuntu` community would come together for
        planning and hacking sessions. This event occurred two times a year, each one
        running for a week. The discussions were highly technical and heavily influenced
        the direction of the subsequent :term:`Ubuntu` release.

        These events were called *"Ubuntu Developer Summit"* (UDS).

        These events are continued since November 2022 as ":term:`Ubuntu Summit`" (US)
        to include the broader :term:`Ubuntu` community and not only developers.

        Ubuntu stable releases are officially published versions of Ubuntu

    Ubuntu Summit
        The *Ubuntu Summit* (US) is a continuation of :term:`Ubuntu Developer Summit`
        since November 2022. The change in name aims to broadening the scope, which
        opens the event up to additional audiences.

        While the :term:`Ubuntu Developer Summit` was focused on technical development,
        the talks and workshops of the *Ubuntu Summit* will cover development as well
        as design, writing, and community leadership with a wide range of technical
        skill levels.
        
        The name also results in a nifty new acronym, *"US"*, or more appropriately,
        simply *"Us"*. This fits very nicely with the meaning of :term:`Ubuntu`,
        *"I am what I am because of who we all are"*.
