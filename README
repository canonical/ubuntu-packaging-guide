The Ubuntu Packaging Guide
--------------------------

This guide is often one of the first things that a new Ubuntu contributor will
look at. Helping make it better can have a big impact.

It is split up into two sections:

- A list of articles based on tasks, things you want to get done.
- A set of knowledge-base articles that dig deeper into specific bits of our
  tools and workflows.

The actual articles can be found under the ``ubuntu-packaging-guide``
directory in rst files. The html template and css can be found under
``themes/ubuntu``. If adding a new article, make sure to add it to the
``ubuntu-packaging-guide/index.rst`` file so that it appears in the table of
contents.

Development is hosted on Launchpad:

Sphinx & reStructured text
--------------------------

The guide is built using `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_. Articles should
be written in reStructuredText. The following links might be helpful:

Building
--------

The power of Sphinx is that it can generate documentation in many formats.
Running ``make all`` will generate the guide in html, dirhtml, singlehtml,
pickle, json, htmlhelp, qthelp, devhelp, epub, latex, latexpdf, text, and
man formats. They will be written to the ``_build`` directory.

Not all of these formats are important to us. You can build an individual
format with, for example, ``make html``. Run ``make help`` for a list of all
targets.

Please at least test your fixes by building the html version.
