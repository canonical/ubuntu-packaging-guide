Communication in Ubuntu Development
===================================

In a project where thousands of lines of code are changed, lots of decisions
are made and hundreds of people interact every day, it is important to 
communicate effectively.

Mailing lists
=============

Mailing lists are a very important tool if you want to communicate ideas
to a broader team and make sure that you reach everybody, even across
timezones.

In terms of development, these are the most important ones:

* https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel-announce 
  (announce-only, the most important development announcements go here)
* https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-devel
  (general Ubuntu development discussion)
* https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-motu
  (MOTU Team discussion, get help with packaging)


IRC Channels
============

For real-time discussions, please connect to irc.libera.chat and join one or
any of these channels:

* #ubuntu-devel (for general development discussion)
* #ubuntu-motu (for MOTU team discussion and generally getting help)
